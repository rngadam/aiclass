4.4a

We know left is clean. move to right might have failed so we retain 5,7.

If the move to the right is successful, then we are in the right square and the tile is dirty or not.

However, dirt might also have spontaneously appeared in all cases... so all squares are valid...

4.4b

every square where the robot is right and the tile is dirty... 2 and 6... also answered in the next question!

4.4c

suck is guaranteed to clean up this tile. every tile that has the robot on the right-side in a clean square (4 and 8)

4.4d

same result as 4.4c
