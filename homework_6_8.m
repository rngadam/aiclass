max:

for 1, where p is probability of min selecting 1:

4*p + -5 * (1-p): p=5/9

for 2, where p is probability of min selecting 1:

-3*p + 5 * (1-p): p=5/8

min:

for 1, where q is probability of max selecting 1:

-4*q + 5 * (1-q): p=5/9

for 2, where q is probability of max selecting 1:

3*q + -5*(1-q): p=5/8
