At the start, we don't know if we are left or right.

So we position ourselves to the right; maybe we were already there, but it doesn't matter as we want to position ourselves.

We suck dirt there (don't know if there is dirt or not)

We go left and suck again.

We are now certain to be at the left square and have sucked both the right and left square clean
