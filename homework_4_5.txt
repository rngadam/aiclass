"It is intentional for the bananas to remain high."

So at the end height(bananas, high) must be false.

And the monkey has no banana, because although we provide for the monkey having the banana when grasping it, we don't track  when he climbs down.

Both the monkey and bananas are At(B), but not at the same height.
