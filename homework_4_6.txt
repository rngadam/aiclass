(c=X)=>poss(dial(c),s)
if c is the correct combination, it's possible to dial it
(0000<=c<=9999)=>poss(dial(c),s)
if c is a combination, it's possible to dial it.

both are true, always possible to dial any number

open(s)=>poss(lock, s)
!open(s)=>poss(lock(s)
true=>poss(lock(s))

the first two are equivalent to the third: always possible to open.  All correct.
 
poss(s,a)=>(open(result(s,a))<=>(a=dial(X)||(open(s)^a!=lock)))

could already be opened...

poss(s,a)=>(open(result(s,a))<=>(a=dial(x)^a!=lock)

redundant right part
